# BoxAnalyzer

Built as a tool for the lessons on https://drawabox.com/.

In 3 point perspective, all lines on a box point to 1 of 3 vanishing points. All three of these vanishing points can be established in the first 5 lines drawn on the box. In a correct box, the positions of the remaining lines are all based entirely off of those first 5 lines.

In the drawabox curriculum, a core excersize is to draw boxes over and over again and analyze your own drawings to build an intuition for what a box should look like and where all of the points of the box should be placed. 

This tool is designed to assist with that analysis by showing the user the correct version of the box they tried to draw.
